# Description of operation

## Temperature setting parameters

Units are in degrees Celsius
* Lower threshold (default 45)
* Upper threshold (default 65)
* Hysteresis (default 3)

## Operation algorithm

After receiving the temperature value from all available sensors, the larger value is used.
If the temperature is lower than the lower threshold, the output is turned off.
When the temperature starts to exceed the lower threshold, the output value changes linearly according to the formula:

Out = (Temp - Min) / (Max - Min) * 15

Where the value Out = 0 corresponds to the minimum fan speed, 15 to the maximum.
If the temperature starts to drop, the fan turns off when the value drops to
(Min - Hysteresis), which is 42 degrees by default.

# Indication

## Initialization

If the first sensor is present - one short flash.
If the second sensor is present - two short flashes.

## Operating mode

Each measurement cycle is accompanied by a short flash.
It is followed by a certain number of short flashes (from zero to 16 corresponding), showing the current speed level.

## Error codes

If an error occurs, the indicator emits a series of long flashes (1.5 s) with pauses of 5 seconds.
The number of flashes in the series determines the error code
